# Security Setup - Summary of Changes

## ✅ Completed Security Setup

All sensitive data has been properly secured in your Photo Restore AI project!

## 📋 What Was Done

### 1. Created `.gitignore` Files

#### Root `.gitignore` (updated)
Added protection for:
- ✅ `.env` files (all variants)
- ✅ `backend/uploads/*` - User uploaded photos
- ✅ `backend/restored/*` - Processed photos

#### Backend `.gitignore` (new)
Created `backend/.gitignore` to exclude:
- ✅ `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local` - Environment variables
- ✅ `uploads/` - Temporary uploaded images
- ✅ `restored/` - Restored/processed images
- ✅ `node_modules/` - Dependencies
- ✅ `*.log` - Log files
- ✅ System files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

### 2. Created Environment Configuration Files

#### `backend/.env.example` (new)
Template file with all required environment variables (safe to commit):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
PORT=3000
ENABLE_GRAYSCALE=false
```

#### `backend/.env` (new)
Your actual environment file (NOT in Git):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
PORT=3000
ENABLE_GRAYSCALE=false
```

**⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED:** You need to add your OpenAI API key to this file!

### 3. Updated Server Code

The `backend/server.js` already properly uses environment variables:
```javascript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});
```

✅ No hardcoded API keys in source code!

### 4. Created Directory Structure

Created `.gitkeep` files to maintain directory structure:
- ✅ `backend/uploads/.gitkeep` - Keeps uploads directory in Git
- ✅ `backend/restored/.gitkeep` - Keeps restored directory in Git

This ensures the directories exist when someone clones the repo, but the contents (user photos) are ignored.

### 5. Fixed Security Vulnerability

🚨 **FIXED:** Removed exposed API key from `backend/OPENAI_SETUP.md`
- ✅ Replaced real API key with placeholder
- ✅ Added warning to use your own key

### 6. Created Security Documentation

Created comprehensive security guides:
- ✅ `SECURITY.md` - Complete security best practices guide
- ✅ Updated `BACKEND_SETUP.md` - Added environment setup instructions
- ✅ Updated `QUICK_START.md` - Added .env configuration steps
- ✅ This summary document

## 🔐 Verification

Run these commands to verify everything is properly secured:

```bash
# Check git status
git status --ignored

# You should see in "Ignored files":
# - backend/.env
# - backend/uploads/
# - backend/restored/
# - backend/node_modules/
```

## 📁 What's Protected

### Files IGNORED by Git (sensitive/large):
- ❌ `backend/.env` - Your actual API keys
- ❌ `backend/uploads/*` - User uploaded photos
- ❌ `backend/restored/*` - Restored photos
- ❌ `backend/node_modules/*` - Dependencies
- ❌ All `.env.local` variants

### Files TRACKED by Git (safe):
- ✅ `backend/.env.example` - Template (no real keys)
- ✅ `backend/.gitignore` - Ignore rules
- ✅ `backend/server.js` - Source code (uses env vars)
- ✅ `backend/package.json` - Dependencies list
- ✅ `backend/uploads/.gitkeep` - Empty placeholder
- ✅ `backend/restored/.gitkeep` - Empty placeholder
- ✅ All documentation files

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Add Your OpenAI API Key

Edit `backend/.env` and add your API key:

```bash
# Windows
cd backend
notepad .env

# Mac/Linux
cd backend
nano .env
```

Add your key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-from-openai
```

Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 2. Verify It Works

Start the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Photo Restore API server running on port 3000
```

### 3. Test the API

Visit: http://localhost:3000/health

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Photo Restore API is running"
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Security Reminders

### ALWAYS:
- ✅ Keep your `.env` file secret
- ✅ Use different API keys for dev/production
- ✅ Check `git status` before committing
- ✅ Rotate API keys if exposed
- ✅ Monitor API usage on OpenAI dashboard

### NEVER:
- ❌ Commit `.env` files to Git
- ❌ Share your API keys publicly
- ❌ Hardcode secrets in source code
- ❌ Push user photos to Git
- ❌ Share `.env` file with anyone

## 📊 Git Status Check

Before your first commit, verify:

```bash
git status
```

✅ **Should see** (modified/new):
- `.gitignore`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `SECURITY_SETUP_SUMMARY.md`
- `BACKEND_SETUP.md`
- `QUICK_START.md`
- `backend/.gitignore`
- `backend/.env.example`
- `backend/OPENAI_SETUP.md` (fixed)

❌ **Should NOT see**:
- `backend/.env`
- `backend/uploads/*.png`
- `backend/uploads/*.jpg`
- `backend/restored/*.jpg`

## 🎉 All Done!

Your project is now properly secured! The following are protected:
- 🔐 API Keys → Environment variables
- 🖼️ User Photos → Ignored by Git
- 📁 Directory Structure → Maintained with .gitkeep
- 📖 Documentation → Updated with security info
